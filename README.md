# caesarBruteforce
This program decodes a single line of Caesar cipher-encrypted
text using a two-pronged approach; brute force and simple heuristics. The program
produces 13 decryption results, then prints two lists. The first list contains
all 13 decryption keys with their results. The second list contains decryption results
which contain keywords.

The original text is displayed as key #0. Key #9 contained keywords "nuke" and "easternfront", and is thus printed as a likely result.
