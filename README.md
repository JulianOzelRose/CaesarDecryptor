# caesarBruteforce
This program is to decodes a single line of Caesar cipher-encrypted
text using a two-pronged approach; brute force and simple heuristics. The program
produces 13 decryption results, then prints two lists. The first list contains
all 13 decryption keys with their results. The second list contains decryption results
which contain keywords.
